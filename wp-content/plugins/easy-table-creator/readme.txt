This plugin makes creating an html table inside of your posts very easy.  Bundled with the jQuery plugin Tablesorter, you can also make your table sortable.

== Description ==

Tables are something that are really useful for anyone creating content on a blog, but can be difficult to code. WordPress does not provide this functionality out of the box.  This plugin uses the text editor (TinyMCE) to help create your table, no coding necessary!  Click a button, and a popup screen will allow you to create table headers, table rows, and table footers.  When you are finished, the plugin will then insert the table into your blog post.  It uses the jQuery table sorter plugin to nicely format the table and make things sortable.
