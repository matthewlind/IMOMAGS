== Search Engine Optimization ==

The Search Engine Optimization (SEO) process can generally be defined as four key parts; content, keywords, site structure and links. Most SEO activity focuses on one or all of these areas. 

Scribe is designed to help authors/writers participate in the SEO process through the intelligent review and analysis of the content on the page. 

First, conduct keyword research to find the best search terms using our Keyword Research tool. Next, we review the content and semantic structure of the content to find the most relevant keyword terms based on search behavior and identify how you can better use these terms within your content. Finally we help you identify related websites, social media users and pages within your current site that are appropriate for link building.

Scribe makes SEO copywriting easy. Try it for yourself.
