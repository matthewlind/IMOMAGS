				<p>Recognizing another trend developing, this time in the reasonably priced, synthetic-stocked and fully adjustable trigger out-of-the-box bolt-action rifle category, Remington introduced the Model 783. Initially available in four calibers and designed by its R&D team from the ground up, it featured a dual-pillar bedding platform that free floats the button rifled magnum contour barrel. It was housed in a new synthetic stock design (with SuperCell recoil pad), and most importantly, was equipped with the new CrossFire trigger system, factory set at 3½ pounds and user-adjustable from 2½ to 5 pounds.</p>
