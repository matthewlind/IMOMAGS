				<h2>1917 Remington-Enfield Model 1917 Military Rifle </h2>
				<p>In January 1917, it became apparent to the U.S. War Department that a great number of rifles would be needed for American soldiers, more than Springfield Armory could supply. The Ordnance Department turned to Rem-UMC to manufacture Springfield Model 1903 bolt-action rifles. Unfortunately, the tools, jigs, and fixtures that Remington had used to manufacture Pattern 14 Rifles were not suited to making Springfield rifles. After much communication, it was decided that Remington could modify its Pattern 14 rifle machinery and produce an entirely new military firearm that had been designed by Major P. T. Goodsal at the Birmingham Small Arms factory in England. The new rifle would fire the .30-06 Springfield cartridge, and the first sample rifle was ready in April. 
				On July 12, 1917, the Ordnance Department contracted with Remington for 300,000 rifles, officially known as the U.S. Rifle, Caliber .30, Model of 1917. Manufacturing went on at a hurried pace, and on October 9, 1918, Remington was given a contract for an additional 250,000 rifles. Eventually, Remington’s Ilion plant would manufacture 646,444 of these rifles before production would end on December 23, 1918. 
				Remington’s Eddystone facility also made Model 1917 Enfield rifles. Pattern 14 rifle production at Eddystone had ceased in late 1916, and the plant had retooled to begin making the new rifles. An astounding 1,181,908 of these rifles were made in the months to come, before production halted on January 9, 1919.</p>
				<h2>Browning Machine Gun</h2>
				<p>In 1917 A.E.F. troops were ill equipped to fight a prolonged, international conflict. Worst of all, German ground troops controlled the battlefield with tens of thousands of state-of-the-art Maxim heavy machine guns. When they arrived, the U.S. Army had no heavy machine guns to speak of and were issued insufficient quantities of European-made second-class guns. The need existed for firearms that were at least as efficient as their German counterparts.
				Answering the call was one of the most famous gun inventors of the last 150 years, John M. Browning. While working at Colt’s armory, he had developed a rapid-fire machine gun that was capable of achieving a cyclic rate of fire in excess of 600 rounds per minute. Officially, it became known as the Browning Machine Gun, Model of 1917, Caliber .30, Water-Cooled. It was classified as a heavy, recoil-operated, belt-fed machine gun and weighed 30 pounds, empty (without seven pints of water in the water jacket).</p>
