				<p>1933 and the years that followed were important for Remington with several major acquisitions that included the Chamberlain Trap & Target Company, the Peters Ammunition Company and Parker shotguns.  On June 1, 1934, Remington Arms Co., Inc. acquired the business relating to the manufacture and sale of Parker shotguns from Charles Parker Co. of Meriden, Connecticut. This included the Parker name, outstanding inventory of guns and parts, and tooling. The Parker Co., operating as Parker Brothers, had suffered through the Depression, and prior to the sale production had fallen to less than five percent of the works' average capacity. In fact, only about 300 Parker guns were made in 1932 and 1933.   This transaction cost Remington $100,000 and came about because Remington wanted to add a quality side-by-side double gun to its sporting shotgun line. This acquisition admirably supplemented Remington’s already varied line of sporting arms. </p><p>  Parker Brothers (Wilbur, Dexter, and Charles Jr.) had excelled in the making of double-barrel shotguns since 1868, and Remington officials vowed that the same high standards of quality for which Parker “Old Reliable” guns are famous would be continued. Remington leased the real estate in Meriden from Charles Parker Estate, Inc., a holding company. Manufacturing was permitted to remain in Meriden, and this new entity of Remington became known as the Parker Gun Works.   Despite the industry prediction that the quality of the famous Parker gun would be cheapened, Remington took steps to keep the well-deserved Parker reputation in place. Remington improved the quality of the wood that went into the new Parker guns, improved the already-good wood-to-metal fit, and Remington designers licked ejector problems that had plagued the Parker gun for many years.   Even after Remington’s acquisition, Parker shotguns continued to be double-fit, usually seen on only the finest European double guns. Double-fit guns start out by being fabricated tight with no tolerances and then the metal parts are casehardened. Then parts are honed down to fit. The result is a gun that has as close to a perfect fit as is mechanically possible. Double-fit guns require a great deal of handwork by expert gunsmiths and are expensive to produce.</p><p>   Inexplicably, Remington did not embark upon an aggressive marketing effort for the Parker gun. Magazine ads for the Parker were nearly nonexistent, and Remington advertised Parker shotguns in a separate catalog from the traditional Remington Arms Co. catalogs. The Parker 1936 Price List offered a number of side-by-side double guns and single-barrel guns. A sampling of the prices for double guns with selective single trigger includes: A.1. Special Grade for $915.60; A.A.H.E. Grade for $763.20; A.H.E. Grade for $528.30; B.H.E. Grade for $385.80; C.H.E. Grade for $282.30; D.H.E. Grade for $217.30; G.H.E. Grade for 162.60; V.H.E. Grade for $129; and the lower-priced Trojan Grade for $89.10. Remington also offered a variety of Parker Double-Barrel Skeet Guns and Trap Guns and five grades of Parker Single-Barrel Trap Guns with the top price of $727.50.   In January 1938, Remington closed Parker’s Meriden Works and moved the gunmakers and machinery, tools, gauges, stock, and other gunmaking equipment to Ilion, where the operation continued to be called Parker Gun Works.   Manufacturing of Parker guns ceased when the U.S. entered World War II, and when America returned to a peacetime economy, marketing studies at Remington showed that there was little market for an expensive, domestically produced double gun.</p>
