					<figcaption>Hartley & Graham had begun as Schuyler, Hartley & Graham, formed in New York City in 1854, as purveyors of military and sporting arms and related accessories. The company grew to immense proportions during the Civil War, and by 1865 it was large enough to acquire two ammunition companies, Crittenden & Tibbals and C. D. Leet & Co. Combining the metallic cartridge machinery of both companies and the know-how of experienced workmen, a new company called Union Metallic Cartridge & Cap Co. was established in Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1867.  The company, later shortening its name to the Union Metallic Cartridge Co. (U.M.C.), eventually made billions of cartridges for sporting and military purposes.<br><span class="photo-credit">Photo Credit: Schuyler, Hartley & Graham 1865 Catalog</span></figcaption>
