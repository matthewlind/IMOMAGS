				<p>Slide-action, repeating shotguns began to become popular in America in the 1880s, when Christopher M. Spencer’s Model 1884 Shotgun was first offered. In 1888 John M. Browning perfected his own design and was issued a patent that eventually became Winchester Models 1890 slide-action rimfire rifle and 1893 and 1897 pump-action shotguns. </p>
		        <p>Since Winchester still owned half of Remington Arms Co., it stopped the Ilion factory from coming out with a competing pump-action shotgun. Winchester’s interest in Remington ended in 1896, and so did its control over what sporting arms could be produced. Remington was offering sportsmen a variety of firearms, but not a pump-action shotgun.</p>
		        <p>A few years later, a Denver gun inventor by the name of John D. Pedersen was issued patents for a unique pump shotgun, and he entered into a business relationship with Remington that would last for more than twenty years. Under Pedersen’s direction, Remington announced its first pump-action shotgun in the 1908 Remington Arms Co. catalog, naming it the Remington Model 1908 Repeating Shotgun and stating that it “will be ready for delivery in the early part of 1908.” </p>
		        <p>The following year, the Remington Arms Co. catalog advertised these as “Pump-Action Repeating Shotguns,” without reference to Model 1908. It would not be until 1911 that this gun became known as the Remington Model 10 Pump-Action Shotgun. </p>
