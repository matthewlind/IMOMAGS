				<p>In April 1922, Remington Arms Co., Inc. announced a new .22-caliber autoloading rifle based on John M. Browning’s patents of 1913, 1914, 1916, and 1921. Primary design improvements were contributed by Remington’s Crawford C. Loomis. When introduced, the new autoloader sold for $28 and was initially chambered for .22 Short rimfire ammunition.</p>
				<p>The Model 24A Standard Grade Rifle was loaded through an opening on the right side of the stock just behind the semi-pistol grip, and the internal magazine held fifteen cartridges. Initially, the Model 24 rifle was made with a nineteen-inch round barrel, measured thirty-seven inches overall, and weighed just four pounds, twelve ounces. Later, the barrel length was increased to twenty-one inches, the overall length became thirty-nine inches, and the rifle weighed in at five pounds.</p>
				<p>In 1923 Remington began offering this autoloader in either .22 Short or .22 Long Rifle (not interchangeable) and in several other grades, including Model 24C Special Grade, Model 24D Peerless Grade, Model 24E Expert Grade, and Model 24F Premier Grade. Remington sold a total of 130,415 Model 24 Autoloading Rifles in a thirteen-year period between 1922 and 1935, when the rifle was replaced by the Model 241 Speedmaster.</p>
