				<p>1927 Ammunition Output Soars By the mid-1920s, Remington offered a full variety of sporting arms and ammunition for hunting, gallery use, personal protection, and plinking including new Kleanbore products. Sales in 1926 were over $18,000,000, and net earnings were $1,414,556. Sales for 1927 were even higher.</p>
				<p>The company’s output of sporting ammunition was the largest in the world (other than for military purposes). Its production of firearms and ammunition together constituted about one-third of the country’s total production of those items. 
In excess of 750,000,000 shotgun shells and rifle and pistol cartridges were manufactured in 1926, and Remington’s production of pocketknives, sheath knives, and other cutlery was at a rate of about 2,500,000 knives per annum—the greatest production of any company in America. At the same time, in both production and sales, Remington was the second largest manufacturer of cash registers in the world.5</p>
				<p>By 1927 the company employed more than 6,500 workers in plants in Bridgeport, Ilion, and Brimsdown. At this time the Bridgeport plant consisted of 323 buildings (1,864,245 square feet); the Ilion plant consisted of sixty-six buildings (1,024,357 square feet).</p>
