					<figcaption>The first production [Model 8] Remington Autoloading Repeating Rifles - No. 1 Standard Grade were ready for delivery in October 1906 and were first advertised in a Remington Arms Co. fourteen-page pamphlet dated 1906. Inexplicably, the first Remington Arms Co. catalog to offer this rifle was its 1908 issue, offering the No. 1 Standard Grade for $30, No. 3 Special Grade for $40, No. 4 Grade for $60, No. 5 Grade for $90, and No. 6 Grade for $140.
