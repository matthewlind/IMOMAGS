							<p>Border to Border was born by a desire to rekindle the adventure of hunting. Like the hunters of old who trekked through the West with only basic provisions, a map of the land and a desire to see new country, we intend to recapture that adventure and excitement in a modern world. The rules are simple and self imposed: travel overland from Mexico to Alaska hunting every state crossed. The only meat consumed is what is killed along the way. All hunts are on land open to the public. No fancy lodges or hotelsâ€”every one of the 45 nights will be spent camping out. No guides or outfitter, just friends and family.
							</p>
							<p>The goal of Border to Border is to not only entertain and rekindle the American love of adventure, but inspire, educate and motivate viewers for their own DIY hunting adventure.
