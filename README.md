IMO Mags
========

We created [IMOMags.com](http://IMOmags.com/) to serve as a temporary site to host IMOutdoors content during an extened outtage. Each theme corresponds to an IMOutdoors Title. 

Themes
------
All the themes use [Carrington Business](http://crowdfavorite.com/wordpress/themes/carrington-business/) as a parent theme. Slight modifications have been made to the parent theme, most notably to remove the wordpress version from the header and automatic ajax loading of posts on click.

Plugins
-------
There are no customizations to the plugins on IMO Mags, though some are planned.
